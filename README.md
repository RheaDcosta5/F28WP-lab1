Lab work for F28WP

Week 3-
  1)Made image carousal slider - To create the carousal slider, I used concepts such as arrays, functions, event handling in javascript to add functionality to the slider made in HTML and CSS to style it. My approach for creating the carousel involved initializing variables, making an array of images, defining a function to slide images, setting an interval to call the function every 3000ms, and adding an event listener to call the function when the window loads. 
  
  2) Form Validation Assignment - I created the form using HTML and used CSS to style it and then I used javascript to add functionality. My approach involved selecting the form and input elements using their IDs and adding event listeners to them. When the form is submitted, function is called to validate all the inputs. There are also separate functions to validate username, email, etc. If an input is invalid, the program displays an error message and is in error state. If it's valid, the input is in success state. The program uses CSS classes to style the input elements based on their state. Real-time validation is also implemented using event listener.
